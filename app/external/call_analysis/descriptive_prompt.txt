<additional_context>

General Instructions
Use the context of prior calls together with the latest call transcript.
Strictly ground all outputs in the actual data provided.
Do not invent or hallucinate facts.
Mark any missing or indeterminable information as "Not Specified".
Maintain a professional tone & use clear, easy sentences.
Output only valid JSON structures — no explanations, summaries, or commentary.

Tasks
Task 1 – Identify the Buyer and Seller
Identify the roles of the speakers.
Example Output:
{
  "speaker_roles": {
    "SPEAKER_00": "Buyer",
    "SPEAKER_01": "Seller"
  }
}

If roles cannot be clearly determined from the transcript, use:
{
  "speaker_roles": "Not Specified"
}

Task 2 – Give a short title for the call
Guidelines
Describe the agenda and result of the call in one line.
Be specific. Use concrete actions, decisions, objections, or next steps discussed.
Use sentence fragments separated by "-" or "|" if needed.
Maximum 10 words.

Example Output:
{
  "call_title": "Follow up call | Existing portfolio with Anand Rathi"
}

Task 3 – Create a summary of the call.

Guidelines
It should include (but not be limited to):
Purpose of the call
Any blockers that may delay or lose the deal
Next steps
It should be written in third person and mention the key contributors to the conversation at least once.
Be specific. Use concrete actions, decisions, objections, or next steps discussed.
Use bullet points. Keep 1 bullet point for each topic/idea.
Maintain the same hierarchy of ideas.
Limit to 5 points.

Example Output:
{
  "call_summary": [
    "Bullet point 1",
    "Bullet point 2",
    "Bullet point 3",
    "Bullet point 4",
    "Bullet point 5"
  ]
}

Task 4 – Call Topics and Detailed Notes
Guidelines
Create clear notes for this conversation.
Notes should be organised into topics. Each topic should have distinct non-overlapping points.
Topics must have distinct, non-overlapping timestamps.
Cover all topics discussed, even casual/rapport topics.
Notes should be written from the point of view of a sales representative, capturing positive and negative signals that may impact deal conversion.

Example Output:
{
  "call_notes": [
    {
      "topic": "Short topic name",
      "topic_type": "rapport building/problem discovery/solution presentation/pricing discussion/next steps/competitor comparison/other",
      "discussion_points": [
        "Point 1",
        "Point 2"
      ],
      "time_stamps": [
        "StartTime-EndTime",
        "StartTime-EndTime"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Task 5 – Capture Action Items for the Seller
Guidelines
Extract all action items mentioned or implied during the call.
If the buyer is supposed to complete a task, then create an action item on the seller to follow up with the buyer about it.
Capture the context of the task so that the buyer remembers what the context was.
Suggest actions that the seller should take to mitigate risks and help the deal go through.
The action_description needs to be clear and comprehensive. Cover questions like what needs to be done, why, and for whom.
The action_call_context should include a summary of the conversation written in third person.
If no date is mentioned, set "action_due_date": "Not Specified".

Example Output:
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_name": "Short task title",
      "action_due_date": "Due date or 'Not Specified'",
      "action_description": [
        "Bullet point 1",
        "Bullet point 2",
        "Bullet point 3"
      ],
      "action_call_context": "Context and past discussions related to this action",
      "action_confidence": "Confidence score out of 100"
    }
  ]
}
If no actions can be determined:
{
  "actions": ["Not Specified"]
}

Task 6 – Deal Title
Guidelines
Based on the provided sales call transcript, generate a short, easily recognisable deal title (maximum 5–6 words).
The title should reflect:
Who the buyer is (e.g., name, company, or role)
What they want (e.g., product, service, solution)
What the potential value of the deal could be (e.g., opportunity size, scope, business impact) — if this is not clear, do not include it
Where they are switching to us from and why (e.g., current tool, first-time switch user, problem areas)
Avoid referencing the current deal stage. Do not include filler words. The tone should be professional and suitable for use in a CRM system.

Example Output:
{
  "deal_title": "Vidur - PMS switch from Anand Rathi"
}

Task 7 – Deal Summary
Guidelines:
Use up to 5 bullet points per section. It is okay to use fewer points if there is no data.
Only use information grounded in the transcript and call history.
Avoid filler or invented details.
Keep language concise, structured, and professional.
Do not modify the JSON structure or add extra keys.

Example Output:
{
    "deal_summary": {
        "deal_overview": [
            "Topic 1 – short summary of topic 1",
            "Topic 2 – short summary of topic 2",
            "Topic 3 – short summary of topic 3",
            "Topic 4 – short summary of topic 4",
            "Topic 5 – short summary of topic 5"
        ]
        "deal_pain_points": [
            "Pain point or issue identified by the client",
            "Reason they are dissatisfied with their current setup",
            "Underlying concern or blocker to decision-making",
            "Additional frustration or limitation",
            "Trigger that made them consider switching"
        ]
        "deal_proposed_solution": [
            "How your offering solves their key issue",
            "Differentiator compared to their current provider",
            "Value proposition tailored to their profile",
            "Flexibility or ease of transition",
            "Any relevant personalization or customization"
        ]
