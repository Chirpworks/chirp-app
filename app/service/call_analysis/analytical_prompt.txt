Tasks

Task 1 – Identify the Buyer and Seller
Identify the roles of the speakers.
Example Output:
{
  "speaker_roles": {
    "SPEAKER_00": "Buyer",
    "SPEAKER_01": "Seller"
  }
}

If roles cannot be clearly determined from the transcript, use:

}

Task 2 – Identify the Deal Stage
Classify the current stage of the deal using one of the following:
Discovery & Lead Qualification
Solution Presentation / Demo
Follow-Up & Stakeholder Alignment

Handoff to Customer Success
Your answer must be based strictly on the transcript and prior context. Include:
Bullet points of actual signals (statements, behaviors, or events).
Your interpretation and reasoning as a sales leader.
A confidence score (0–100) based on subjective assessment.


Example Output:
{
  "deal_stage": {
    "deal_stage": "Solution Presentation / Demo",
    "stage_signals": [
      "Prospect asked how Dezerv differs from Anand Rathi",
      "Seller explained differences between MF and stock-based PMS providers"
    ],
    "stage_reasoning": [
      "The client is actively comparing options and asking clarifying questions",
      "Seller is in pitch mode, emphasizing benefits and differences"
    ],
    "stage_confidence": 85
  }
}
If there is not enough data to determine a stage, output:
{
  "deal_stage": {
    "deal_stage": "Not Specified",
    "stage_signals": [],
    "stage_reasoning": ["Insufficient data in transcript to confidently determine deal stage"],
    "stage_confidence": 0
  }
}

Task 3 – Key Focus Areas
As an experienced sales leader, identify 2–4 focus areas at this stage of the deal that can help drive conversion.
Example Output:
{
  "focus_areas": [
    "Reinforce performance differentiation from current PMS",
    "Address perceived risks of switching providers",
    "Clarify the transition timeline and process",
    "Build confidence in Dezerv's long-term approach"
  ]
}
If insufficient data exists, output:
{
  "focus_areas": ["Not Specified"]
}


Task 4 – Risks & Hesitations

      "risk": "Client is hesitant about making a switch",
      "risk_signal": "Client repeatedly asked about the complexity of transition",
      "risk_reasoning": "This suggests underlying fear of disruption or effort involved"
    }
  ]
}

If there are no risks evident or data is insufficient:

  "risks": ["Not Specified"]
}

Task 5 – Suggested Actions for Sales Rep

Example Output:
{
  "suggested_actions": [
    {
      "suggested_action_name": "Send Portfolio Comparison Report",
      "suggested_action_due_date": "2025-05-06",
      "suggested_action_description": "Share a comparative performance report between Anand Rathi and Dezerv's PMS approach",
      "suggested_action_reasoning": {
        "reasoning": "Prospect mentioned dissatisfaction with current performance. A comparison will highlight the value of switching to Dezerv.",
        "signals": ["Client expressed underperformance concern in prior call"],
        "suggested_action_confidence": 90
