# Tasks
## Task 1 – Identify the Buyer and Seller
Identify the roles of the speakers. Use this information to perform all following tasks.

**Example Output:**
{
  "speaker_roles": {
    "SPEAKER_00": "Buyer",
    "SPEAKER_01": "Seller"
  }
}

If roles cannot be clearly determined from the transcript, use:
{
  "speaker_roles": "Not Specified"
}

## Task 2 – Identify the Deal Stage
Classify the current stage of the deal using one of the following:
1. "Discovery & Lead Qualification" - First stage - usually seller asks about the current situation, pain points. During this initial stage the seller may briefly pitch the product and position it as a solution
2. "Solution Presentation / Demo" - Second Stage - Seller explains the product, implementation, benefits in detail. This may be supplemented with a product demo as well.
3. "Stakeholder Alignment" - Third stage - seller addresses specific challenges that the buyer may have. This is usually a deep dive into how to transition to the service or product the seller is offering.
4. "Negotiation / Approval" - Fourth Stage - Pricing & implementation discussions once everything else has been finalised
6. "Likely Won" - Fifth stage - When the buyer has explicitly communicates that everything is okay and that they will be going with the seller's product/service
7. "Likely Lost" - Terminal Stage - this can happen after any of the prior stages but before the payment is made

**Instructions**
1. Take time your time to think carefully about what are the key events and discussions that have taken place.
2. Your answer must be based strictly on the transcript and prior call context. 
3. Use bullet points in the stage_reasoning to clearly articulate your reason for choosing this stage.
4. Include quotes from the transcript if needed in the stage_signals
5. Think like an experienced sales leader to decode subtle behavioural signals from the buyer
6. Assign a confidence score (0–100) based on subjective assessment.


**Example Output:**
{
  "deal_stage": {
    "deal_stage": "Solution Presentation / Demo",
    "stage_signals": [
      "Prospect asked how Dezerv differs from Anand Rathi",
      "Seller explained differences between MF and stock-based PMS providers"
    ],
    "stage_reasoning": [
      "The client is actively comparing options and asking clarifying questions",
      "Seller is in pitch mode, emphasizing benefits and differences"
    ],
    "stage_confidence": 85
  }
}
If there is not enough data to determine a stage, output:
{
  "deal_stage": {
    "deal_stage": "Not Specified",
    "stage_signals": [],
    "stage_reasoning": ["Insufficient data in transcript to confidently determine deal stage"],
    "stage_confidence": 0
  }
}

## Task 3 – Identify Key Focus Areas for this stage
As an experienced sales leader, identify 2–4 focus areas at this stage of the deal that can help drive conversion. 

**Instructions**
1. The focus areas should be to mitigate obvious risks and move the deal to the next stage.
2. Keep the tone professional
3. Use crisp and easy to understand language. Sentences should be short.

**Example Output:**
{
  "focus_areas": [
    "Reinforce performance differentiation from current PMS",
    "Address perceived risks of switching providers",
    "Clarify the transition timeline and process",
    "Build confidence in Dezerv's long-term approach"
  ]
}
If insufficient data exists, output:
{
  "focus_areas": ["Not Specified"]
}


## Task 4 – Risks & Hesitations
As a sales leader with an expertise in consumer psychology and an understanding of common pitfalls, outline major risks to this deal. Risks may completely derail or delay the deal. 

**Instructions**
1. Pay special attention to implicit risks such as delay tactics, strong incumbent, and personal agendas.
2. Be careful not to fabricate or hallucinate.
3. All risks must be grounded in the call data provided.

**Example Output:**
{
  "risks": [
    {
      "risk": "Client is hesitant about making a switch",
      "risk_signal": "Client repeatedly asked about the complexity of transition",
      "risk_reasoning": "This suggests underlying fear of disruption or effort involved"
    }
  ]
}

If there are no risks evident or data is insufficient:
{
  "risks": ["Not Specified"]
}

## Task 5 – Suggested Actions for Sales Rep
As a sales leader who is mentoring a junior sales rep, suggest next steps to drive the deal forward. 
**Instructions**
1. Suggested Actions should be:
1a.Specific to this deal and current stage
1b. Designed to mitigate risks, clarify doubts, align stakeholders, qualify lead, remove unknowns, qualify lead
2. Make sure the due date is not before the call took place and not in the distant future.
3. action_description should cover all aspects of what needs to be done. Remember you are guiding a junior sales rep so give tips on how to perform that action well. It should be written in bullet points with crisp and clear sentences.

Example Output:
{
  "suggested_actions": [
    {
      "suggested_action_name": "Send Portfolio Comparison Report",
      "suggested_action_due_date": "2025-05-06",
      "suggested_action_description": [
        "Share a comparative performance report between Anand Rathi and Dezerv's PMS approach",
        "Include a section on difference additional tax saving benefits"
        "Include a section on flexibility of approach that Dezerv offers that allows for a more aggressive allocation should the client choose so."
      ]
      "suggested_action_reasoning": {
        "reasoning": "Prospect mentioned dissatisfaction with current performance. A comparison will highlight the value of switching to Dezerv.",
        "signals": ["Client expressed under performance concern in prior call"],
        "suggested_action_confidence": 90
      }
    }
  ]
}
If no actions can be determined:
{
  "suggested_actions": ["Not Specified"]
}
